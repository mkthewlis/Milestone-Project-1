                            In the early spring of 2016, the three founders of The Career
                            Changers met for dinner. Each of them explained how unhappy
                            they were with their current careers and shared their
                            frustration at not knowing where to turn for guidance and
                            inspiration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            By the end of the meal, they had made their decision:
                            together, they would use their experience of wanting to change
                            their career paths to create a boutique consultancy. The
                            founding aim would be to offer their clients the service that
                            they themselves had wanted but were unable to find.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Now with four years of growth and successful client stories
                            behind them, they oversee a team of 20 consultants
                            specialising in different fields and markets. And although
                            their expertise differs, they all share the passion to see
                            others grow and flourish.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Andy, Malin and Sid look forward to many more years of growth,
                            learning and satisfied Career Changers.
